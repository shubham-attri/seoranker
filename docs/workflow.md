# Development Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines our step-by-step development process for the SEO Content Generator, ensuring we follow best practices and get appropriate approvals at each stage.

## Core Principles
1. **Incremental Development**: Build and test one component at a time
2. **Documentation First**: Document the approach before implementation
3. **Approval Gates**: Get explicit approval before moving to next steps
4. **API Alignment**: Follow LangChain's latest API patterns

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Setup âœ…
- [x] Create project structure with Poetry
- [x] Set up basic dependencies
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [ ] APPROVAL NEEDED: Review initial setup and dependencies

### 2. Tools Implementation
- [ ] Exa AI Integration
  ```python
  # Example from LangChain API

- [ ] APPROVAL NEEDED: Review implementation


### 4. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] APPROVAL NEEDED: Review documentation

### 5. Rules 
- Always Follow the rules and guidelines.
- Always index the whole codebase.
- Always make sure that the codebase is working as expected.
- Always make sure that in which directory you are before adding the new file.
- You can ignore any lint errors and warnings, but make sure to fix them before committing the code.
