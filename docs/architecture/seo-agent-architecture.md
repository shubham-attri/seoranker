# Search Engine Optimization Content Generator Architecture

## Overview

We aim to build a system that automates SEO content creation by:
1. Auditing the user’s site to determine content gaps and areas of improvement.
2. Collecting and analyzing suggested keywords to target.
3. Conducting web searches (using Exa AI) to retrieve top-performing competitor articles on these keywords.
4. Combining and improving those articles (structured with robust heading tags) into high-quality drafts.
5. Automatically iterating or refining the content with a multi-agent approach that harnesses external tools such as Exa AI (for scraping, searching) and LangChain Agents (for orchestrating tasks).

This system is intended to be used within a "Poetry" project environment (i.e., Python with Poetry as the package manager).

## Example Use Case

1. A user inputs a domain (like example.com) and the list of seed keywords they wish to rank for.
2. The system orchestrates multiple Agents:  
   - “Audit Agent” to check the site’s SEO health and gather existing pages’ keyword coverage.  
   - “Keyword Research Agent” to refine or propose additional keywords to target.  
   - “Competitor Analysis Agent” to fetch competitor articles using Exa AI’s web scraping/search tools.  
   - “Content Generation Agent” to assemble and refine new blog drafts, focusing on user-provided or discovered keywords.

## System Components

### 1. Data and Configuration Layer

• “Project/Config Store”: Maintains site details, initial seed keywords, user preferences (e.g., brand tone, style guides), and ML model credentials.  
• “SEO Performance Data”: Historical performance data (if available), plus third-party SEO metrics or analytics (also fed as context for the Agents).

### 2. Tooling and Integrations

• “Exa AI Wrapper”: Tool/Agent for executing targeted web searches, scanning competitor content, and scraping articles.  
• “LangChain Tools”:  
  - Web-based search (fallback if Exa AI is insufficient).  
  - Python REPL or CSV Tools for data transformations.  
  - Optional text-moderation or summarization tools for safety and quick overviews.  

### 3. Agents (Multi-Agent System)

Following Anthropic’s “Building effective agents” patterns, we use a combination of:

1. “Prompt Chaining” and “Routing” Workflows ([1](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents))  
   - We can route tasks to specialized Agents, e.g., an Agent specifically for auditing vs. an Agent specifically for generating SEO-friendly text.

2. “Parallelization”  
   - For big tasks like analyzing multiple competitor sites, we can run parallel fetches or evaluations, then aggregate them.

3. “Orchestrator-Workers”  
   - An Orchestrator Agent organizes overall tasks, breaks them into subtasks, then delegates to specialized Worker Agents for each subtask (site audit, competitor scanning, writing content, etc.).  
   - The Worker Agents may leverage the same or different LLMs, each specialized in unique tasks.

4. “Evaluator-Optimizer”  
   - After the initial blog post or set of heading tags is generated, an Evaluator Agent provides feedback (e.g., “Add more SEO keywords,” “Rewrite for clarity,” or “Use more synonyms for better semantic coverage”).  
   - The Content Generation Agent makes iterative improvements in a feedback loop.

Below is a breakdown:

#### (a) Audit Agent
• Inputs: Website URL, relevant SEO metrics.  
• Task: Access the site (via direct scraping or CSV exports), identify existing metadata, headings, and keyword usage.  
• Approach:   
  - Use “prompt chaining” to generate a step-by-step site audit.  
  - Possibly call an external SEO analysis API if available.  

#### (b) Keyword Research Agent
• Inputs: Seed keywords, social media/Google trends data.  
• Task: Expand or refine keywords based on performance potential, related synonyms, etc.  
• Approach:  
  - “Prompt chaining” or “orchestrator-workers” if we want multiple expansions in parallel.  
  - Use Exa AI web search to gather real-time suggestions.

#### (c) Competitor Analysis Agent
• Inputs: Final set of target keywords.  
• Task: Use Exa AI to web-search, find top results for each keyword, scrape summarized competitor content, glean best headings, structures, or topics.  
• Approach:  
  - “Parallelization” for fetching data on multiple keywords simultaneously.  
  - Merge data into a central store or pass it back to the Orchestrator.

#### (d) Content Generation Agent
• Inputs: Results from Audit, Keyword Research, Competitor Analysis.  
• Task: Create multi-section blog drafts or article outlines, with headings that incorporate discovered best practices.  
• Approach:  
  - “Evaluator-optimizer” loop: first generate a draft, then have an Evaluator Agent refine it, ensuring all targeted keywords are included.  
  - Potential final output includes a recommended SEO title, meta description, structured headings, internal linking suggestions, etc.

### 4. Workflow Orchestrator

1. Receives the project-level request (“Generate 5 new SEO blogs for these 3 seed keywords!”).  
2. Breaks the request into subtasks: run the Audit Agent, then run the Keyword Research Agent, etc.  
3. Aggregates intermediate results:
   - Merge competitor data, expansions, brand voice instructions, etc.  
4. Calls the Content Generation Agent with the relevant context.  
5. Invokes the Evaluator Agent if needed, letting it critique or refine.  
6. Finalizes the blog content for user export (e.g., Markdown or HTML).

### 5. Memory and Storage

• LangChain-provided ConversationBufferMemory or VectorStore-based memory to keep track of progress across Agents.  
• Possibly a knowledge base of competitor headings or domain-specific phrases.  
• Persistent logging (LangSmith or similar) for debugging agent decisions.

### 6. Iteration and Human in the Loop

• The system can pause for user approvals:
  - “Do you like these headings?”  
  - “Should we add brand-specific disclaimers?”  
• The system can also re-run or refine certain steps, e.g. re-check competitor content or re-run the SEO analysis after new pages are published.

### 7. Recommended SEO Best Practices
When integrating the multi-agent system, ensure that each generated article or blog post adheres to common Search Engine Optimization principles:
1. Proper Heading Structure (H1, H2, H3) for readability and crawlability.
2. Well-crafted meta titles and meta descriptions for clear user-facing summaries.
3. Use of alt text for images to improve accessibility and keyword coverage.
4. Implementation of canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues.
5. Internal linking that helps search engines understand site structure and relevance.
6. Inclusion of relevant, user-focused keywords in headings, subheadings, and body text without keyword stuffing.
7. Fast page-load performance by optimizing media and code, ensuring better user experience and higher ranking potential.
8. Mobile-friendly design following responsive practices, as mobile search is particularly critical.
9. Schema markup or structured data for richer SERP features (e.g., FAQ, breadcrumbs).
10. Regularly updated, high-quality content that addresses user search intent authentically.

## Proposed Stack

1. **Python + Poetry**: For package management and reproducible environments.  
2. **LangChain**: For building Agents and adding toolsets.  
3. **Exa AI**: For searching the web, scraping competitor content, or retrieving real-time SEO data.  
4. **Database / VectorStore**: Possibly Chroma, Pinecone, or FAISS for content chunking and retrieval.  
5. **LLM Providers**:  
   - (Optional) OpenAI or Anthropic for large generative tasks.  
   - Potential usage of open-source models if private data compliance is required.

## Key Advantages and Considerations

1. **Modularity**: The multi-agent approach keeps each step (Auditing, Keyword Expansion, Competitor Analysis, Content Generation) logically separate.  
2. **Scalability**: By using parallelization for large tasks (like checking multiple competitor sites), we can keep execution time in check.  
3. **Flexibility**: Additional specialized Agents can easily be added (e.g., an Agent to handle images or optimize code references for dev blogs).  
4. **Reliability & Guardrails**:  
   - “Evaluator-optimizer” loops reduce errors.  
   - You might incorporate a gating mechanism to ensure no steps exceed a certain budget/time.  
   - Human-in-the-loop for final polishing or brand tone.

## Next Steps

1. Initialize the Poetry project, installing langchain, exa AI’s Python bindings, and any essential libraries (requests, beautifulsoup4, etc.).  
2. Implement minimal prototypes for each Agent.  
3. Test the Orchestrator’s end-to-end flow on smaller tasks (e.g., a single Site Audit -> single Keyword -> Content Generation).  
4. Add iterative improvements (Evaluator loops, more concurrency, better memory management).  
5. Optionally integrate a UI or admin dashboard for quick “Approve/Reject” steps.
